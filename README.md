#### 1.1 Booking time is defined as the time taken from the leadcreation until the booking status changes to COMPLETED. For each of the cities 'Gurgaon' and 'Noidaâ€™, calculate average booking time (in days) for each product for all completed bookings within the last 30 days.
&nbsp;<br>
#### The result should have 3 columns: city_name, product_name, average_booking_time.
```
select cm.city_name, pm.product_name, avg(datediff(bd.completed_at, bd.created_at)) avg_booking_time
from lead_details ld
left join booking_details bd on bd.lead_id = ld.id
left join customer_registration_details crd on crd.id = ld.customer_id
left join product_master pm on pm.id = ld.product_id
left join cities_master cm on cm.id = city_id
where bd.status = 'COMPLETED' and cm.city_name in ('Gurgaon', 'Noida')
and bd.completed_at > (curdate() - interval 30 day)
group by cm.id, pm.id
```

#### 1.2 For each city (Gurgaon and Noida) and each day of the week, determine the percentage of registrations on a particular day that resulted in a successful lead generation within 24 hours of the user registration.

#### Consider only the first 7 days of 2021 for user-registration.
&nbsp;<br>
#### The result should have 4 columns: city_name, date, total_registrations, percentage_lead_generated.

```
select cm.city_name, date(bd.created_at) created_at,
count(crd.id) total_registrations,
(count(case when db.status = 'COMPLETED' then crd.id else null end)/count(crd.id))*100 percentage_lead_generated
from lead_details ld
left join booking_details bd on bd.lead_id = ld.id
left join customer_registration_details crd on crd.id = ld.customer_id
left join product_master pm on pm.id = ld.product_id
left join cities_master cm on cm.id = city_id
where cm.city_name in ('Gurgaon', 'Noida') and date_format(bd.created_at) between '2021-01-01' and '2021-01-07'
group by date, cm.id
